This CSS code is designed to style a webpage, focusing on enhancing usability and aesthetics for a language learning or speech practice interface. Here's a breakdown of its components:

Font Family: The entire body of the webpage uses a sans-serif font, which is clean and easy to read, making the text accessible for all users.

Header Styling: The header has a light gray background (#f0f0f0) and is padded to ensure the content inside is spaced out comfortably. This makes the header distinct from the rest of the page.

Title Alignment: The main heading (h1) is centered, drawing attention to it as a focal point of the webpage.

Language Selection Layout: A flex container (#language-selection) is used to evenly space out language selection options (presumably buttons), facilitating an intuitive choice of language for the user.

Button Styling: Buttons are styled with padding for comfort, a light border (#ccc), rounded corners for a modern look, and a cursor pointer to indicate clickable areas, enhancing user interaction.

Activity Container: The activity section (#activity-container) is designed to align items in the center and organize content in a column, making the structure clear and focused for users.

Content Boxes: Elements like instructions, activity content, and feedback are given margins and padding for readability, and bordered (#ddd) with rounded corners for a soft, organized appearance.

Feedback Message: The feedback message (#feedback-message) is bolded, making it stand out to users, which is crucial for drawing attention to important notes or corrections.

Record Button: A special style is applied to the record button (#record-button), with a contrasting blue background (#337ab7), white text for readability, and no border, making it visually appealing and easy to identify as an action item.

Progress Bar Styling: The progress section (#progress) uses flex to align its items (like a progress bar and counter) centrally, with a bold font weight for the progress count (#progress-count), emphasizing the user's progression through the activities.
